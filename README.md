# Mushroom Classification
This project aims to classify mushrooms into poisonous or edible categories based on their physical characteristics. The dataset used in this project contains information on the cap diameter, cap shape, cap surface, cap color, stem height, and other features of mushrooms.

# Data
The data used in this project was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is a secondary dataset that was cleaned and preprocessed before being used in this project. The dataset contains 61,069 instances and 21 features, including a target variable indicating whether the mushroom is poisonous or edible.

# Tools and Libraries
This project was implemented using Python programming language and the following libraries were used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

# Results
The project resulted in a model that can classify mushrooms into poisonous or edible categories with an accuracy of 95%. A pairplot was created to visualize the relationships between different features and their correlation with the target variable.

# Conclusion
In this project, we used machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms into poisonous or edible categories based on their physical characteristics. The results show that it is possible to accurately classify mushrooms using these characteristics. This project can be used to identify poisonous mushrooms and prevent poisoning incidents.
